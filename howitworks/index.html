<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>What exactly happens when you, say, deposit 100 DAI into 88mph for 1 year at 10% fixed-rate APY?</p>
<ol>
<li>Your 100 DAI is transferred to 88mph.</li>
<li>88mph deposits the 100 DAI into a yield-generating protocol with variable rate APY, which will generate yield for the 1 year deposit period.</li>
<li>Once the 1 year is over, you withdraw 110 DAI from 88mph.</li>
</ol>
<p>At first glance, this may seem extremely problematic. To begin with, how is this different from simply juggling your own money around? Secondly, if the yield-generating protocol failed to generate 10 DAI of yield from the 100 DAI given to it in 1 year, you can't guarantee that you can withdraw 110 DAI from 88mph.</p>
<p>These objections are resolved by 88mph through pooling the deposits together. Pooling deposits means putting the deposited DAI into a single pool, from which users can withdraw a deposit once its deposit period is over.</p>
<p>How would pooling help?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk balancing</strong>: If the floating rate APY rose after a deposit, the yield generated by the deposited funds could be more than the interest promised to the user. This surplus would be able to balance out the debt caused by deposits where the floating rate has dropped since the time of deposit. This way, risk of insolvency is reduced for the users, and the stability of 88mph's interest rate is supported.</li>
<li><strong>Overlapping deposit periods</strong>: If an older deposit could not generate enough yield to cover the debt caused by the interest promised to the depositor, and its deposit period would be over soon, the yield could still be paid out using the funds of other deposits. This alone obviously does not solve the debt, but combined with risk balancing and the volatility in the floating interest rate it helps with keeping the 88mph pool solvent.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="floating-rate-bonds">Floating-rate bonds<a class="headerlink" href="#floating-rate-bonds" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Simply doing the above, though, would make 88mph a fairly risky product: if the floating rate APY drops to a very low value and stays there for a long time, deposits made when the floating rate was still high would not by themselves generate enough interest to cover the original interest payouts, and neither would the deposits made after the rates dropped help with this situation. This would cause a pool-wide insolvency event.</p>
<p>This is why 88mph also offers another mechanic called <strong>floating-rate bonds</strong>. Buying floating-rate bonds allows someone to immediately fill up the debt of one or more deposits using their own money, and in exchange they would receive the yield generated by those deposits. Given that each 88mph deposit would generate enough yield to cover its own deficit as long as the average interest rate during the deposit period stays above 75% of the initial value, a bond buyer would earn a profit as long as the interest rate doesn't drop by more than 25%.</p>
<p>Not only do floating-rate bonds significantly reduces the risk of depositing into 88mph, it also provides a brand new financial product that allows users to <strong>long the interest rates of lending protocols</strong>. It's similar to some other products that allows people to long and short interest rates (<a href="https://lsdai.market/">LSDai</a>), except 88mph's floating-rate bonds provides a profit even if the interest rate drops (as long as it doesn't drop by more than 25%), and provides even more profits if the interest rate rises. It's like leverage-longing the interest rate!</p>
<h2 id="interest-rate-model">Interest rate model<a class="headerlink" href="#interest-rate-model" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>At the moment, 88mph uses a linear model for determining the fixed interest rate offered to depositors. 88mph keeps track of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the underlying yield protocol's APY over roughly a monthly window, and offers 75% of the EMA as the fixed rate.</p>
<p>We have plans to implement more sophisticated interest rate models in the future that take into account paramters such as the pool surplus/debt, floating-rate volatility, pool total deposit, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="towards-structured-products">Towards structured products<a class="headerlink" href="#towards-structured-products" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The first line of products offered by 88mph could allow us or another protocol to build structured products on top of our first layer, <strong>guaranteeing the capital</strong> or a significant portion of such to maturity.</p>
<p>We could imagine a mechanism that gives rise to this structure by the combination of a fixed income instrument and the use of derivatives, in this case in particular, an option (eg <a href="https://www.hegic.co">hegic.co</a>).</p>
<p>As far as we know, there is nothing like that in DeFi, so it could be a new market segment to explore after stabilizing our first layer of products.</p>

<p>88mph represents deposits and bonds using ERC-721 standard non-fungible tokens. This means that users can transfer them between accounts, buy or sell them on exchanges, put wrappers around them to add more features, and more! The limit is your imagination.</p>
<p>Some possible use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deposited a lot of money into 88mph, but suddenly need cash? And you still want your deposit to generate profit? Well, you can take out a loan on lending platforms like <a href="https://medium.com/@AlexMasmej/introducing-rocket-get-a-loan-against-your-nfts-f67b1b5738f0">RocketNFT</a> using your deposit NFT as collateral, and pay it back once you withdraw your deposit. Magic!</li>
<li>You can wrap your bond NFT with an ERC20 token to sell it out fractionally.</li>
<li>Or simply attach a creation of your favorite NFT-artist.</li>
