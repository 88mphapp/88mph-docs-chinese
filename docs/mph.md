# MPH tokenomics

## Initial issuance

88,000 MPH is minted and will be distributed via liquidity mining. The program begins at 10:30 am PT 11/16/2020 and lasts 14 days.

To participate, follow these steps:

1. Deposit into an 88mph pool, or buy a floating-rate bond. This will give you some upfront MPH.
2. Provide liquidity to [the MPH-ETH Uniswap pair](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xfd9aacca3c5f8ef3aaa787e5cb8af0c041d8875f)
3. Stake the Uniswap LP token [here](https://88mph.app/farming)

## Depositor rewards

When a user makes a deposit in an 88mph pool, they will receive newly-minted upfront MPH tokens proportional to the amount of fixed-rate interest earned by the deposit. They can then stake this MPH in [the MPH rewards pool](https://88mph.app/rewards) to earn their share of protocol fees and yield-farming rewards. When the deposit is mature and the user wants to withdraw it, they will have to pay back a proportion of the upfront MPH tokens (currently 90%). These MPH tokens will be sent to the 88mph governance treasury, where MPH holders can vote on how to spend them.

This distribution model ensures that existing users will have an amplified influence in the governance process and income sharing, which aligns the interest of the protocol with the interest of the users, rather than the interest of speculators.

## Bond buyer rewards

When a user buys a floating-rate bond, they will receive newly-minted upfront MPH tokens proportional to the amount they paid for the bond. They can then stake this MPH in [the MPH rewards pool](https://88mph.app/rewards) to earn their share of protocol fees and yield-farming rewards.

## Developer fund

Whenever MPH is minted by new deposits/bond purchases, an additional 10% of the minted amount is minted and sent to the developer fund. These MPH will be used to pay for future development & maintenance of the protocol.

## Governance treasury

The governance treasury receives the MPH tokens paid back by depositors when they withdraw their deposits. These MPH will be used by whatever the MPH holders decide on.
